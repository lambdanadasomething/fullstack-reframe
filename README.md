# fullstack-reframe

Experiment to develop an up-to-date template for doing modern frontend using Clojurescript.

## Library/Tool used

- Tooling: `shadow-cljs` and integration with `lein` using `lein-shadow` plugin
- UI: `re-frame`
- Theme: Using *Elastic UI* from JS ecosystem
- Routing: Using `reitit` (and its accompanying suite of libraries) as it supports data-driven, fullstack, as well as reverse-routing
- Server Side Render (SSR): Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Server using `Macchiato`, a clojurescript server running on node.js
- (Planned) More State Management: `datascript` and using localStorage and the likes? Also investigate libraries for integrating with `re-frame`. Or just roll our own.
- (Planned) API/fetch: TBD
- (Planned) GraphQL: `re-graph`

Additional Tools:

- `mockoon-cli` for mocking server
